<h2> This is a section on Bass Fish </h2>
<p class="paragraph"> Bass Fish live in lakes. The word for
fish in latin is <i> Pisces </i> </p>
<p class="paragraph"> A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic 
craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and 
cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), 
allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers 
like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2] Fish are 
abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, 
from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal 
depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,100 described 
species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates﻿</p>
